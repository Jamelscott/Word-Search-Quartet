# Crossword Quartet

## Elevator pitch
You have 1 minute to find 10 words in the word-search puzzle. If you can complete four word-searches without the timer going out, you win! Be warned, the crossword puzzles get larger as you dance through the 4 stages. You will have one extra-time card you can use if you're in a pinch.

## MVP goals
* build a word-search board
* build a countdown timer
* build a round scoreboard (ex: round 1/3)
* create a list of words 
* circle or highlight when each letter of a word in clicked in sequence
* strike out words in the list when found
* highlight timer when time is running out
* when first board is complete, start a new board that is larger, restart timer and provide 10 new words
* rinse & repeat until the game is lost, or the fourth round is won.
* add a more time button that a player can use once during the game to provide an extra 10 seconds
* when game is over, add a play again button.


## stretch goals
* every time the board is generated, the words are in a new place
* add a circle around the found words (similar to handwritten word-searches)
* sound prompt on last 10 seconds
* slowly generate the board with words instead of instantly.
* play a quick orchestral sound when complete.
