# WordSeach Countdown

## Elevator Pitch
Welcome to WordSearch Countdown. There are three wordsearch puzzels to complete but you only get credit if you complete them in the alloted time. Be warned, you the levels get harder as you make your way through the breezy, tricky and tough levels. Your progress will be kept on the main screen in case you forgot which games you've completed. 




## Tech stack
* HTML/CSS/JS



## Quick Sketc
[Here is the intial concept](https://i.ibb.co/8XJBKz8/IMG-5564.jpg)



## MVP Goals
* build a word-search board (hard-coded)
* build a countdown timer
* create a list of words (hard-coded)
* circle or highlight when each letter of a word in clicked in sequence
* strike out words in the list when found
* when game is over, add a play again button.


## Stretch Goals (complete)
* when first board is complete, start a new board that is larger, restart timer and provide 10 new words
* add three levels of incrementing difficulty
* list the rules on main menu
* keep track of game progress on main menu
* let the player know when all levels are complete
* when you return to main menu, have the text in the rules change slightly
* provide a button to return to main menu instead of an instant return


## Stretch Goals (incomplete)
* add a circle around the found words (similar to handwritten word-searches)
* highlight timer when time is running out
* add a more time button that a player can use once during the game to provide an extra 20 seconds
* every time a board is generated, the words locations are different
* sound prompt on last 10 seconds
* slowly generate the board with words instead of instantly
* (completed with a dif. method) play a quick orchestral sound when complete
* (completed with a dif. method) build a round scoreboard (ex: round 1/3)
